    "\n",
    "We want to count cells across multiple subjects, conditions, brain regions, and experimental conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Overview\n",
    "You have an excel sheet with information about brain region cell counts. We want to compare the number of active cells across two conditions. Each sheet in the excel sheet represents and is labeled by condition:\n",
    "-   condition1\n",
    "-   condition2\n",
    "\n",
    "We have counted cells in 3 brain regions in three areas: anterior, medial, and posterior (you can think of them as front, middle, and back of each region)\n",
    "-   region1\n",
    "-   region2\n",
    "-   region3\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also counted cells in these three regions that talk to two other regions:\n",
    "-   regionA\n",
    "-   regionB \n",
    "\n",
    "We have injected some pretty colors to label projections (red and green) - this means if I inject red into regionA and I see red in region1, I know region1 talks to regionA through neurons that start in region1 and travel to regionA. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also marked and counted which cells were active. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also have individual subjects with IDs such as: \n",
    "-   1_1\n",
    "-   2_1\n",
    "-   2_2\n",
    "-   2_3\n",
    "-   6_1\n",
    "and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the excel sheet \n",
    "You have two columns on each sheet in the excel: \n",
    "-   slice\n",
    "-   count\n",
    "\n",
    "how to read slice names: area_region_SubjectID_active_colors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example slice names\n",
    "\n",
    "**posterior_region3_1_anterior_regionion1_1_1_active**: this means the count in this row represents the number of cells in a posterior (back) slice of brain region1 from Subject 1_1 of active cells ONLY (that are not green or red, just active) \n",
    "\n",
    "**posterior_region3_1_anterior_regionion1_1_1_active_green**: this means all of the same stuff except this count is for active cells that are also green \n",
    "\n",
    "**posterior_region3_1_anterior_regionion1_1_1_green**: similarly this means this count is for cells that are only green and NOT active. \n",
    "\n",
    "### GOAL\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to count cells across all subjects and conditions that are active or that talk to regionA (including those that talk to regionB) or regionB (including those talk to regionA). \n",
    "Additionally, the experimenter injected green into regionA *most of the time* but not all of the time. So in order to know which brain regions are talking to which we need to map subjects to their injection color pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with this in mind we need to \n",
    "1. map subjects to brain regions by color\n",
    "2. reformat the data\n",
    "3. calculate new totals\n",
    "4. confirm our totals are correct \n",
